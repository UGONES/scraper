The problem that the project was facing was dues to an error or fixes from an npm package. I had to download a different version to get it running problem.

To be precise, with express version 5 which the project came with, has incremented changes made by the owners of the package to server better software developer, with that change it affected the current state of how the previous version should be functioning. So I downloaded version 4 so that the project can adapt to the package.
